### Fuel Stations Core

This project is intended to replace FuelStations service written in express/turf.

The idea behind FuelStations service is to find all reachable diesel stations in some specified distance from truck route.

Web server: express/nodejs => asp.net core

GIS solution: [turfjs] => [NetTopologySuite]
